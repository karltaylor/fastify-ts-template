# fastify-ts-template

A super basic fastify-ts-template.

- `yarn dev` to run locally and watch for changes (uses [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) & [vite-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-node))
- `yarn build` to compile typescript into `./dist`
- `yarn start` to start the server
